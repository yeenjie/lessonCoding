1 Everybody negotiates all the time. Some people seem to be born negotiators, but for others, negotiation can be a painfully difficult and embarrassing process. To conclude a negotiation to mutual 
satisfaction, we should view conflict as a problem to be solved, and 
shift the focus
 from defeating each other
 to defeating the problem.    2 If we see our needs as
 in opposition and start to argue back and forth making demands, counter-demands, there is no likelihood of producing a creative 
outcome. Instead, we should see our true interest as 
complementary and collaborate to reach effective settlement for mutual benefit.
